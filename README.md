Abstract

In the last years, job recommender systems have become popular sincethey successfully reduce information overload by generating personal-ized job suggestions. Although in the literature exists a variety of tech-niques and strategies used as part of job recommender systems, mostof them fail to recommending job vacancies that ﬁt properly to the jobseekers proﬁles. Thus, the contributions of this work are threefold, we:i) made publicly available a new dataset formed by a set of job seekersproﬁles and a set of job vacancies collected from diﬀerent job searchengine sites; ii) put forward the proposal of a framework for job recom-mendation based on professional skills of job seekers; and iii) carriedout an evaluation to quantify empirically the recommendation abilitiesof two state-of-the-art methods, considering diﬀerent conﬁgurations,within the proposed framework. We thus present a general panoramaof job recommendation task aiming to facilitate research and real-worldapplication design regarding this important issue.

Overview

Nowadays, job search is a task commonly done on the Internet using job search engine sites like LinkedIn1,Indeed2, and others. Commonly, a job seeker has two ways to search a job using these sites: 1) doing a querybased on keywords related to the job vacancy that he/she is looking for, or 2) creating and/or updating aprofessional proﬁle containing data related to his/her education, professional experience, professional skills andother, and receive personalized job recommendations based on this data. Sites providing support to the formercase are more popular and have a simpler structure; however, their recommendations are less accurate than thoseof the sites using proﬁle data.

Proposal

We describe our framework for job recommendation. We narrow down the scope and focus onrecommendation of job vacancies for Information Technology (IT) professionals acting in the Brazilian market.The proposed framework, is composed by three stages: data collection, data preparation and recommendation.
